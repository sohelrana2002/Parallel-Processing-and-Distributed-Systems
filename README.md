# What is Parallel Processing?
Parallel processing is a computing technique where multiple processors execute tasks simultaneously to reduce execution time and increase performance.

## Key Concepts:
- Data Parallelism
- Task Parallelism
- Shared Memory Model
- Distributed Memory Model
- Speedup & Efficiency

# What is a Distributed System?
A distributed system is a collection of independent computers that appear to users as a single coherent system.

## Characteristics:
- Scalability
- Fault Tolerance
- Consistency
- Transparency
- Concurrency
